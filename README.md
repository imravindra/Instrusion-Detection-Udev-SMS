# Instrusion-Detection-Udev-SMS
A udev program to get a sms whenever someone enter a usb device in your system.
sms.py file is responsible for getting a sms. This file will run only when someone inserts a usb device in your system.

For this, I created a UDEV rule, so that only when someone inserts a usb device in your system then only this file will run. There are multiple third party companies through which you can get limited free sms. Some o fthe companies are way2sms, twilio, sinchsms.

I used SinchSMS for my little project. 
The detailed steps for implementing this project can be found in udevsmsravi.txt
